If you construct a PlantUMLClassDiagramConfigBuilder - as recommended - , you need to choose between four constructor options: define specific packages to add all classes inside these packages via the scanpackages parameter to the diagram define specific packages in combination with an blacklist regular expression to add only specific classes of these packages on the classpath to the diagram define a whitelist regular expression to add all classes found by this expression on the classpath to the diagram define specific packages in combination with a whitelist regular expression to add only classes to the diagram which match the scan packages and the regular expression If you have done this, you can add the following list of parameters via builder methods: withClassloader to specify the classloader to search for the classes addAdditionalPlantUmlConfigs to add additional PlantUML configuration to the beginning of the generated PlantUML diagram addJPAAnnotations to add JPA annotations of the classes to the diagram withFieldBlacklistRegexp to filter out fields of the shown classes in the diagram via a regular expression withFieldClassifierToIgnore for a single classifier or withFieldClassifiersToIgnore for multiple classifiers to filter out fields via their classifiers withHideClasses to hide classes from the diagram (they are still part of the diagram but they are not rendered) withHideFieldsParameter to hide all fields of the classes in the diagram (they are still part of the diagram but they are not rendered) withHideMethods to hide all methods of the classes in the diagram (they are still part of the diagram but they are not rendered) withMaximumFieldVisibility to filter out all fields of the classes in the diagram by their visibility in java withMaximumMethodVisibility to filter out all methods of the classes in the diagram by their visibility in java withMethodBlacklistRegexp to filter out methods of all classes in the diagram by a regular expression withMethodClassifierToIgnore for a single classifier or withMethodClassifiersToIgnore for multiple classifiers to filter out methods via their classifiers removeFields to remove fields completely from the diagram (they are not part of the unrendered diagram) removeMethods to remove methods completely from the diagram (they are not part of the unrendered diagram) useShortClassNames to shorten the class names in the diagram useShortClassNamesInFieldsAndMethods to shorten the class names only in fields and methods in the diagram useSmetana to activate Smetana as replacement for GraphViz/Dot for layouting After you configured everything you can construct the PlantUMLClassDiagramConfig object via the build() method and pass this configuration as parameter to the PlantUMLClassDiagramGenerator and create the diagram text. Here is a simple example for the usage of the PlantUMLClassDiagramConfigBuilder with three parameters (scanpackages, hideClasses, destinationClassloader) retrieved from the JUnit tests: List scanPackages = new ArrayList<>(); scanPackages.add(\"de.elnarion.test.domain.t0001\"); List hideClasses = new ArrayList<>(); (1) hideClasses.add(\"de.elnarion.test.domain.ChildB\"); PlantUMLClassDiagramConfigBuilder configBuilder = new PlantUMLClassDiagramConfigBuilder(scanPackages) (2) .withHideClasses(hideClasses); (3) PlantUMLClassDiagramGenerator generator = new PlantUMLClassDiagramGenerator(configBuilder.build()); (4) String result = generator.generateDiagramText(); (5) String expectedDiagramText = IOUtils.toString(Objects.requireNonNull(classLoader.getResource(\"class/0001_general_diagram.txt\")), StandardCharsets.UTF_8); assertNotNull(result); assertNotNull(expectedDiagramText); assertEquals(expectedDiagramText.replaceAll(\"\\\\s+\", \"\"), result.replaceAll(\"\\\\s+\", \"\")); 1 list of strings (class names) is declared for parameter hideclasses 2 packages with all classes to show in the diagram are added as string list 3 parameters hideclasses and classloader are added to configuration builder 4 generator is initialized with configuration of builder 5 diagram is generated the result of this generation is @startuml class de.elnarion.test.domain.t0001.BaseAbstractClass { {method} +doSomething () : void {method} +doSomethingElse () : void {method} +doSomethingWithParameter ( paramString1 : String ) : void {method} +doSomethingWithReturnValue () : String } interface de.elnarion.test.domain.t0001.BaseInterface { {method} {abstract} +doSomething () : void {method} {abstract} +doSomethingWithParameter ( paramString1 : String ) : void {method} {abstract} +doSomethingWithReturnValue () : String } class de.elnarion.test.domain.t0001.ChildA { } class de.elnarion.test.domain.t0001.ChildB { } class de.elnarion.test.domain.t0001.Util { } de.elnarion.test.domain.t0001.BaseAbstractClass ..|> de.elnarion.test.domain.t0001.BaseInterface de.elnarion.test.domain.t0001.ChildA --|> de.elnarion.test.domain.t0001.BaseAbstractClass de.elnarion.test.domain.t0001.ChildB --> de.elnarion.test.domain.t0001.Util : util de.elnarion.test.domain.t0001.ChildB --|> de.elnarion.test.domain.t0001.BaseAbstractClass hide de.elnarion.test.domain.ChildB @enduml which is rendered in PlantUML this way:","title":"Configuration","component":"plantuml-generator-util","version":"latest","name":"config","url":"/plantuml-generator-util/latest/class-diagram/config.html","titles":[{"text":"Configuration options","hash":"_configuration_options","id":1},{"text":"Builder customization","hash":"_builder_customization","id":2},{"text":"Builder usage example","hash":"_builder_usage_example","id":3}]},"6":{"id":6,"text":"You have two basic options to configure the PlantUMLSequenceDiagramGenerator for diagram generation: construct a PlantUMLSequenceDiagramConfig object on your own and pass it into the constructor of the generator (not recommended) use the PlantUMLSequenceDiagramConfigBuilder to build the configuration object and pass it into the constructor of the generator (recommended) The first approach to fill all configuration data in an object of type PlantUMLSequenceDiagramConfig and pass it into the PlantUMLSequenceDiagramGenerator constructor is supported but should not be used, as it is not so readable and more errorprone than the third option via the PlantUMLSequenceDiagramConfigBuilder class and therefore this option is the recommended one. If you construct a PlantUMLSequenceDiagramConfigBuilder - as recommended - , you need to pass to mandatory parameters to it: the name of the class where the sequence starts the name of the method where the sequence starts (this name needs to be unique or a random method with the same name is chosen) If you have done this, you can add the following list of parameters via builder methods: class blacklist regular expression to filter out the classes being part of the diagram classloader to specify the classloader to search for the classes hide method name to hide the names of the called methods in the diagram hide super class to show the method call as part of the child class instead of the super class ignore JPA entities to remove all calls to a JPA entity from the sequence flow ignore standard classes to remove all calls to a standard classes (every package starting with java.*) from the diagram method blacklist regular expression to filter out calls to methods in the sequence flow show return types to show the type of the return types in the diagram use short class names to use only the class name itself without the package name After you configured everything you can construct the PlantUMLSequenceDiagramConfig object via the build() method and pass this configuration as parameter to the PlantUMLSequenceDiagramGenerator and create the diagram text.

Because full qualified names increase the size of the diagram enormously the toggle is activated by default. The parameter itself targets all class names in the diagram, even the return types of the method calls which can be shown by the show return types parameter. The default value of this configuration parameter is true.
