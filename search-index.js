If you construct a PlantUMLClassDiagramConfigBuilder - as recommended - , you need to choose between four constructor options: define specific packages to add all classes inside these packages via the scanpackages parameter to the diagram define specific packages in combination with an blacklist regular expression to add only specific classes of these packages on the classpath to the diagram define a whitelist regular expression to add all classes found by this expression on the classpath to the diagram define specific packages in combination with a whitelist regular expression to add only classes to the diagram which match the scan packages and the regular expression If you have done this, you can add the following list of parameters via builder methods: withClassloader to specify the classloader to search for the classes addAdditionalPlantUmlConfigs to add additional PlantUML configuration to the beginning of the generated PlantUML diagram addJPAAnnotations to add JPA annotations of the classes to the diagram withFieldBlacklistRegexp to filter out fields of the shown classes in the diagram via a regular expression withFieldClassifierToIgnore for a single classifier or withFieldClassifiersToIgnore for multiple classifiers to filter out fields via their classifiers withHideClasses to hide classes from the diagram (they are still part of the diagram but they are not rendered) withHideFieldsParameter to hide all fields of the classes in the diagram (they are still part of the diagram but they are not rendered) withHideMethods to hide all methods of the classes in the diagram (they are still part of the diagram but they are not rendered) withMaximumFieldVisibility to filter out all fields of the classes in the diagram by their visibility in java withMaximumMethodVisibility to filter out all methods of the classes in the diagram by their visibility in java withMethodBlacklistRegexp to filter out methods of all classes in the diagram by a regular expression withMethodClassifierToIgnore for a single classifier or withMethodClassifiersToIgnore for multiple classifiers to filter out methods via their classifiers removeFields to remove fields completely from the diagram (they are not part of the unrendered diagram) removeMethods to remove methods completely from the diagram (they are not part of the unrendered diagram) After you configured everything you can construct the PlantUMLClassDiagramConfig object via the build() method and pass this configuration as parameter to the PlantUMLClassDiagramGenerator and create the diagram text.
